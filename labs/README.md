# Lab 7
I choose to use Amazing-QR for my project 7, Amazing-QR can change text content to a QR Code and combine it with a picture or gif.
You can install Pillow by using PIP, use a virtual enviroment before test:

```powershell
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv ~/venv/webscraping/
~/venv/webscraping/Scripts/activate.ps1
pip install amzqr
```


After installing, use Powershell to open lab7.ps1 to see the example.
There is also an example in the labs folder
document for Amazing-QR: https://github.com/x-hw/amazing-qr/blob/master/README.md
